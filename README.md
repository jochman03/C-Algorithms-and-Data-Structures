# C Algorithms & Data Structures Project

This repository contains a collection of **C implementations for algorithms and data structures**, developed for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in programming and computer science.

## Implemented Modules

- **Matrix** – Dynamic matrix operations: creation, deletion, addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, scalar operations, determinant calculation.
- **Doubly Linked List** – Dynamic list operations: insertion at beginning/end, deletion (first, last, specific position, or entire list), search, get/set values, forward and backward printing, memory handling.

- **Unrolled Linked List** – Efficient dynamic list storing multiple values per node: creation, deletion, insertion, deletion by index, search, access by index, printing, and memory management.
- **Queue** – Dynamic circular queue operations: creation, enqueue, dequeue, peek, automatic resizing, length check, empty check, and printing contents.
- **Hash Table** – Dynamic structure with operations: creation, insertion (with quadratic probing), search, deletion, printing contents, memory management, and collision handling.
- **Skip List** – Probabilistic layered list supporting fast operations: creation, insertion, deletion by key, search by key, display by level, and memory management.
